# UPDATE
It saddens us to say that, due to a lack of team members, Project PECO has been officially cancelled as of May 13th, 2020. The project may be brought back up again if enough people are willing to join the project, but as of now the remaining member(s) don't have enough time to work on this, and there simply aren't enough members and skillsets available to continue.

If you would like to help bring this project back up from the grave, feel free to contact the project lead, Sparkfire, in the <em>New Game!</em> discord server linked below.

# Project PECO
Project PECO is a prototype/recreation of the video game PECO from season 2 of the anime <em>New Game!</em>, being developed in Unity by members of the <em>New Game!</em> discord server.
